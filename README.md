# tester

Based on the user's request for an API tester feature that echoes back any input text, combined with the information gathered from the searches on API testing best practices and the creation of an echo API with FastAPI, the following detailed project plan is proposed:

**Project Overview:**
The goal is to develop a user-friendly API tester feature capable of echoing back any text input by the user. The feature will serve as a valuable tool for developers to test and debug their APIs by checking the handling of request data and ensuring the API's response mechanisms are functioning as expected.

**Technical Stack:**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **API Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** Prisma

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Set up the development environment by installing Python, FastAPI, and necessary libraries including Uvicorn for running the ASGI server.
2. Utilizing FastAPI, create a simple API that contains an endpoint to echo texts. The endpoint `/echo/{text}` will accept text inputs via HTTP GET requests and return a JSON response containing the echoed text.
3. Ensure the API handles different data types and special characters in the input text properly, without errors.
4. Integrate PostgreSQL using Prisma ORM to potentially log requests and responses for further analysis and debugging purposes, although the primary function of this API will not involve database operations.
5. Conduct thorough testing following best practices, covering various API request combinations, and validating all possible responses. Include security and performance tests to ensure the API is robust against common vulnerabilities and can handle expected loads.
6. Document the API, detailing its usage, endpoint descriptions, expected request formats, and example responses. Provide guidance on setting up the local development environment for testing purposes.
7. Deploy the API on a test server and set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines for automatic testing and deployments on code changes.

**Testing and Validation:**
To ensure the API tester feature meets quality standards, perform unit tests and integration tests, testing all possible input scenarios and monitoring the responses. Utilize automation tools to streamline this process.

**Conclusion:**
The API tester feature will immensely aid in the development and testing of APIs, offering a simple yet effective tool for echoing back input text. This tool will not only facilitate testing for response handling but also provide insights into potential improvements in API design and functionality.

## What you'll need to run this
* An unzipper (usually shipped with your OS)
* A text editor
* A terminal
* Docker
  > Docker is only needed to run a Postgres database. If you want to connect to your own
  > Postgres instance, you may not have to follow the steps below to the letter.


## How to run 'tester'

1. Unpack the ZIP file containing this package

2. Adjust the values in `.env` as you see fit.

3. Open a terminal in the folder containing this README and run the following commands:

    1. `poetry install` - install dependencies for the app

    2. `docker-compose up -d` - start the postgres database

    3. `prisma generate` - generate the database client for the app

    4. `prisma db push` - set up the database schema, creating the necessary tables etc.

4. Run `uvicorn project.server:app --reload` to start the app

## How to deploy on your own GCP account
1. Set up a GCP account
2. Create secrets: GCP_EMAIL (service account email), GCP_CREDENTIALS (service account key), GCP_PROJECT, GCP_APPLICATION (app name)
3. Ensure service account has following permissions: 
    Cloud Build Editor
    Cloud Build Service Account
    Cloud Run Developer
    Service Account User
    Service Usage Consumer
    Storage Object Viewer
4. Remove on: workflow, uncomment on: push (lines 2-6)
5. Push to master branch to trigger workflow
